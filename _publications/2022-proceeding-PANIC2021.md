We present the elliptic azimuthal anisotropy coefficient ($$v_2$$) of the identified strange hadrons, $$\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ and $$\Lambda$$, in pPb and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV at mid-rapidity ($$\lvert y \rvert <1$$), and the heavy-flavor hadrons, D$$^0$$ and $$\mathrm{J/\psi}$$ in pPb at 8.16 TeV and high-multiplicity pp at 13 TeV and $$\mathrm{\Upsilon(1S)}$$ and $$\mathrm{\Upsilon(2S)}$$, in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The data samples were collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The $$v_2$$ coefficients of identified strange hadrons were measured using the scalar product and multi-particle cumulant methods as a function of $$p_{\text{T}}$$ for different centralities in PbPb collisions and event multiplicities in pPb collisions and compared with inclusive charged hadrons as well as the hydrodynamic calculations with initial conditions. The $$v_2$$ coefficients of D$$^{0}$$ and $$\mathrm{J/\psi}$$ mesons in pPb collisions are measured using the long-range two-particle correlation technique and compared with the results from color glass condensate (CGC) model. The positive $$v_2$$ results of D$$^0$$ and $$\mathrm{J/\psi}$$ in high multiplicity pp and pPb collisions suggest the collectivity of charm quarks in small system. For the first time, collectivity of b hadrons are studied via non-prompt D$$^0$$ using long-range two-particle correlation technique and $$\mathrm{\Upsilon(1S)}$$ and $$\mathrm{\Upsilon(2S)}$$ mesons using scalar product method. The $$v_2$$ results for $$\mathrm{\Upsilon(1S)}$$ meson as a function of $$p_{T}$$ is compared with theoretical predictions from five different approaches. These measurements provide insights into the origin of the collective phenomena in small and large systems.
