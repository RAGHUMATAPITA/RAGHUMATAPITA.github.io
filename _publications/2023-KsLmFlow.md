The collective behavior of  $$\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ and $$\Lambda/\overline\Lambda$$ strange hadrons is studied by measuring the elliptic azimuthal anisotropy ($$v_2$$) using the scalar-product and multiparticle correlation methods. Proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16~\text{TeV}$$ and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02~\text{TeV}$$ collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC are investigated. Nonflow effects in the pPb collisions are studied by using a subevent cumulant analysis and by excluding events where a jet with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV is present. The strange hadron $$v_2$$ values extracted in pPb collisions via the four- and six-particle correlation method are found to be nearly identical, suggesting the collective behavior. Comparisons of the pPb and PbPb results for both strange hadrons and charged particles illustrate how event-by-event flow fluctuations depend on the system size.
