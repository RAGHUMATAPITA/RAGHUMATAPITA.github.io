Measurements of high transverse momentum ($$p_{\text{T}}$$) charged particles in light ion collisions probe the onset of medium-induced parton energy loss and the formation of a hot, deconfined medium in small systems. In this note, we report the first measurement of the $$p_{\text{T}}$$-differential invariant cross section for charged particles in minimum-bias neon-neon collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.36~\text{TeV}$$, in the range $$3<p_{\text{T}}<100$$ GeV, using $$0.76~\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$$ of data collected with the CMS detector in 2025. The corresponding nuclear modification factor, computed using a proton-proton reference at the same energy, is also presented.  The results are compared to various theoretical predictions incorporating parton energy loss effects. When examined together with existing oxygen-oxygen, xenon-xenon, and lead-lead data, the neon-neon data allow for a comparative study of system-size dependence of nuclear suppression effects in a model-independent way. These measurements provide experimental constraints on the minimal conditions needed for the emergence of a collective state of deconfined quarks and gluons created in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
