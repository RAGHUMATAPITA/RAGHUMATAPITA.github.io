A hot and dense state of nuclear matter, known as the quark-gluon plasma, is created in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei.  Highly energetic quarks and gluons, collectively referred to as partons, lose energy as they travel through this matter, leading to suppressed production of particles with large transverse momenta ($$p_{\text{T}}$$).  Conversely, high-$$p_{\text{T}}$$ particle suppression has not been observed in proton-lead collisions, raising questions regarding the minimum system size required to observe parton energy loss.  Oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions examine a region of effective system size that lies between these two extreme cases.  The CMS detector at the CERN LHC has been used to quantify charged-particle production in OO collisions for the first time via measurements of the nuclear modification factor ($$R_{\text{AA}}$$). The data for OO and proton-proton collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $$\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} = 5.36~\text{TeV}$$ correspond to integrated luminosities of $$6.1~\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$$ and $$1.02~\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$$, respectively.  The $$R_{\text{AA}}$$ is below unity at lower $$p_{\text{T}}$$ values, with a local minimum of $$0.69\pm0.04$$ at $$p_{\text{T}}=6$$ GeV, but this suppression becomes weaker with increasing $$p_{\text{T}}$$.  The data exhibit better agreement with theoretical models incorporating parton energy loss as compared to baseline models without energy loss.
