The two particle correlations as a function of relative momenta of identified hadrons involving $$\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ and $$\Lambda/\overline\Lambda$$ are measured in PbPb collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} = 5.02~\text{TeV}$$ with the data samples collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Such correlations are sensitive to the quantum statistics and possible final state interactions between the particles. The source radii are extracted from $$\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ correlations in different centrality regions and found to decrease from central to peripheral collisions. The strong interaction scattering parameters are extracted from $$\Lambda\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ and $$\Lambda\Lambda$$ correlations using the Lednick\'y--Lyuboshitz model, and compared with other experimental and theoretical results.
