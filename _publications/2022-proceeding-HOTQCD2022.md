Two-particle correlations as a function of relative momentum are measured for $$\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$, $$\Lambda$$, and $$\overline\Lambda$$ strange hadrons. The data were obtained for PbPb collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} = 5.02~\text{TeV}$$ using the CMS detector at the LHC. Such correlations are sensitive to  quantum statistics and to possible final-state interactions between the particles. The source radii are extracted from $$\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ correlations in different centrality regions and are found to decrease from central to peripheral collisions. The strong-interaction scattering parameters (i.e., scattering length and effective range) are extracted from $$\Lambda\text{K}^{0}_{\text{S}}$$ and $$\Lambda\Lambda$$ correlations using the Lednicky-Lyuboshits model and compared with other experimental and theoretical results.
