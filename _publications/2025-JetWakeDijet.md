Jets, the collimated streams of particles produced by a hard-scattered quark or gluon, have been used as tomographic probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The diffusion wake associated with a Mach cone is a predicted, distinctive response of the QGP medium to an energetic parton traversing it. Experimental evidence for the diffusion wake was actively sought at existing collider facilities, but these studies were largely inconclusive. This phenomenon, a depletion of soft hadrons on the away side of a propagating jet, was recently observed by CMS for the first time in $$\text{Z}$$-boson-jet events in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} = 5.02~\text{TeV}$$. Despite the limited data sample and small $$\text{Z}$$-boson cross section, CMS correlations of $$\text{Z}$$ bosons with charged particles provided the first clear evidence of the effect. In this work, the wake effect is firmly established and quantified using rapidity-separated back-to-back dijets from the same 5.02 TeV PbPb data recorded by CMS. The wake is analyzed using the jet-hadron correlation technique by comparing dijet correlations at different pseudorapidity separations and examining modifications in PbPb collisions relative to proton-proton (pp) collisions.
