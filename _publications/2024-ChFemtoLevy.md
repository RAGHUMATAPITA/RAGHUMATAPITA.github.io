Two-particle Bose-Einstein momentum correlation functions are studied for charged-hadron pairs in lead-lead collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $$\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} = 5.02~\text{TeV}$$. The data sample, containing $$4.27\times10^9$$ minimum-bias events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $$0.607~\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$$, was collected by the CMS experiment in 2018. The experimental results are discussed in terms of a L'evy-type source distribution. The parameters of this distribution are extracted as functions of particle pair average transverse mass and collision centrality. These parameters include the L'evy index or shape parameter ($$\alpha$$), the L'evy scale parameter ($$R$$), and the correlation strength parameter ($$\lambda$$). The source shape, characterized by $$\alpha$$, is found to be neither Cauchy nor Gaussian, implying the need for a full L'evy analysis. Similarly to what was previously found for systems characterized by Gaussian source radii, a hydrodynamical scaling is observed for the L'evy $$R$$ parameter. The $$\lambda$$ parameter is studied in terms of the core-halo model.
