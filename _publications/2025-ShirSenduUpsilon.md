The relative production cross sections of the excited $$\Upsilon(\text{2S})$$ and $$\Upsilon(\text{3S})$$ mesons to the ground state $$\Upsilon(\text{1S})$$, measured through their dimuon decay channels, are investigated as functions of the charged particle multiplicity in proton-lead collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $$\sqrt{s_{_{\text{NN}}}} = 5.02~\text{TeV}$$. The analysis is based on data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $$175~\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$$. A decreasing trend in these ratios with increasing charged particle multiplicity is observed.
