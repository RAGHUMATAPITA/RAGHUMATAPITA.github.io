Research interests
======
My research focuses on experimental heavy-ion physics, emphasizing the study of quark-gluon plasma properties through jet structure and substructure modification, medium response, two- and multi-particle correlations, flow measurements, and femtoscopy. Further details are provided in my research statement.
