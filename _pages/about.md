I am from Beligopinathpur, a small village under Jaleswar town in Balasore district, Odisha, India. After completing high school in Jaleswar in 2008 and my undergraduate studies at Fakir Mohan University, Balasore in 2013, I moved to Bhubaneswar in 2016 to pursue a masterâ€™s degree at Utkal University, where I chose high-energy physics as a specialization, inspired by Prof. Swapna Mohapatra, and completed an internship at the Gamma Ray Astronomy PeV EnergieS Phase-3 (GRAPES-3) experiment at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Ooty. I then joined the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Chennai for my Ph.D., focusing on experimental heavy-ion physics with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and received my Ph.D. in 2023. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago, continuing my research on heavy-ion collisions with the CMS experiment.
