I am from Beligopinathpur, a small village under Jaleswar town in Balasore district, Odisha, India. After completing high school in Jaleswar in 2008 and my undergraduate studies at Fakir Mohan University, Balasore in 2013, I moved to Bhubaneswar in 2016 to pursue a master’s degree at Utkal University, where I chose high-energy physics as a specialization, inspired by Prof. Swapna Mohapatra, and completed an internship at the Gamma Ray Astronomy PeV EnergieS Phase-3 (GRAPES-3) experiment at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Ooty. In 2018, I joined the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Chennai for my Ph.D., focusing on experimental heavy-ion physics with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and received my Ph.D. in 2023. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago, continuing my research on heavy-ion collisions with the CMS experiment.

My research focus
======

As an experimental heavy-ion physicist, my research focuses on the Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP), an extraordinary state of matter that filled the universe a microsecond or so after the Big Bang. The QGP is extremely hot (above $$T_\text{c} \approx 156$$–$$158$$ MeV, over 100,000 times hotter than the Sun’s core) and dense (above $$\epsilon_\text{c} \approx 0.3$$–$$0.4$$ GeV/fm$$^{3}$$, more than twice the density of ordinary nuclear matter), where quarks and gluons are deconfined and interact strongly to form a nearly perfect fluid. Because of the strength of these interactions, theory alone cannot provide even a baseline description of strongly interacting matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), making experimental exploration indispensable.

Relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a powerful means to study strongly interacting matter under controlled laboratory conditions. By colliding heavy nuclei (Pb, Au, Xe, Ne, O) at nearly the speed of light, we can briefly recreate the conditions of the early universe. These collisions evolve through multiple stages, probing different aspects of QCD -- from the earliest partonic interactions to the emergent collective behavior of the QGP. Investigating these processes reveals how QCD matter behaves at extreme temperatures and densities, advancing our understanding of the strong interaction and the universe’s earliest moments. At CERN, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), such studies are carried out at unprecedented energies, offering unique opportunities to probe the fundamental properties of the QGP. As part of this global effort, I contribute through the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC.

My research employs a variety of probes to study QGP properties. Jets, collimated streams of particles, serve as ``hard probe'' that lose energy while traversing the medium, producing soft particles at wide angles through jet quenching, which modifies both their structure and substructure. Another important effect, medium response, arises from how the QGP itself reacts to passing jets, further influencing these modifications. By studying jet structure and substructure alongside medium response, we can quantitatively probe the QGP’s properties, such as transport coefficients, density, effective temperature, and parton–medium interaction strength, as well as its evolution and dynamics, the mechanisms of parton energy loss, and the detailed processes underlying jet–medium interactions. The QGP’s collective behavior, characterized by flow coefficients, is studied through two- and multiparticle correlations, which reveal how pressure gradients and fluctuations in the initial collision geometry drive anisotropic particle emission. Flow coefficients provide information on the QGP’s viscosity, equation of state, and interaction strength. Complementing these macroscopic observables, femtoscopy examines correlations of particles in relative momenta, offering a microscopic view of the space–time structure of particle emission and the QGP’s size and lifetime. More recently, I have extended my research to heavy-flavor physics, studying how the medium and final-state interactions influence heavy-quark production.
